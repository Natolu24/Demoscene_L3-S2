# Demoscene_L3-S2
A demoscene made in C using OpenGL, SDL and GL4D, with the limitation of the executable and assets that needs to be at a maximum of 64 kilobytes.

Took this opportunity to try creating shader to make wave on water, using the sum of sines technique.
But contrary to making somewhat real looking water, I went and had fun doing "extreme waves" for different type of visuals.
